# Function Fitting
The goal of this repository is to share a suite of programs written in Python to deal with the function fitting: it contains both machine and deep learning solutions, tools and examples. Namely, regarding deep learning, it contains code written for TensorFlow 2.x and for PyTorch 1.x; regarding machine learning, it contains some regressors like XGBoost.

## Common
[common](./common) folder contains common scripts and tools.

## One Variable Function
[one-variable-function](./one-variable-function) contains tools and examples about the fitting of a real-valued scalar function of one real-valued variable.

## Two Variables Function
[two-variable-function](./two-variables-function) contains tools and examples about the fitting of a real-valued scalar function of two real-valued variables.
