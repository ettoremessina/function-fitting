# Function Fitting
The goal of this repository is to share a suite of programs written in Python to deal with the function fitting: it contains both machine and deep learning solutions, tools and examples. Namely, regarding deep learning, it contains code written for TensorFlow 2.x and for PyTorch 1.x; regarding machine learning, it contains some regressors like XGBoost and PyCaret.

## Common
[common](./common) folder contains common scripts and tools.

## SVR
[svr](./svr) contains tools that implement the fitting of functions using Support Vector Regressor.

## XGBoost
[xgboost](./xgboost) contains tools that implement the fitting of functions using XGBoost regressor.

## PyCaret
[pycaret](./pycaret) contains tools that implement the fitting of functions using PyCaret.
