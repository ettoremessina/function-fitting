# SVR
This part of current repository contains a set of Python examples to call the Support Vector Regressor wrapper in order to fit real-valued scalar functions of one real-valued variable using the SVR.

Please go to [svr](../../srv) folder on this repository to see the SVR regressor wrapper scripts.

Please visit [here](https://computationalmindset.com/en/machine-learning/fitting-with-configurable-svr.html) for details.

## Examples
[examples](./examples) contains shell scripts to show how to use in cascade the various programs of this repository to perform regressions of real-valued scalar functions of one real-valued variable using the Support Vector Regressor.
