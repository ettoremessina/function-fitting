# XGBoost
This part of current repository contains a set of Python examples to call the XGBoost regressor wrapper in order to fit real-valued scalar functions of one real-valued variable using the XGBoost regressor.

Please go to [xgboost](../../xgboost) folder on this repository to see the XGBoost regressor wrapper scripts.

Please visit [here](https://computationalmindset.com/en/machine-learning/fitting-with-configurable-xgboost.html) for details.

## Examples
[examples](./examples) contains shell scripts to show how to use in cascade the various programs of this repository to perform regressions of real-valued scalar functions of one real-valued variable using the XGBoost regressor.
