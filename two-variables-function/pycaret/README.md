# PyCaret
This part of current repository contains a set of Python examples to call the PyCaret wrapper in order to fit real-valued scalar functions of two real-valued variables using PyCaret regression feature.

Please go to [pycaret](../../pycaret) folder on this repository to see the PyCaret regressor wrapper scripts.

Please visit [PyCaret on Computational Mindset](https://computationalmindset.com/en/machine-learning/fitting-functions-with-pycaret.html) for details.

## Examples
[examples](./examples) contains shell scripts to show how to use in cascade the various programs of this repository to perform regressions of real-valued scalar functions of two real-valued variables using PyCaret regression feature.
