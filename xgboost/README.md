This part of current repository contains a set of Python programs to implement the fitting of real-valued functions of multiple variables using the XGBoost regressor.

The scripts with suffix miso (multiple input single output) are designed for real scalar functions; the script with suffix mimo (multiple input multiple output) are designed for real vector functions.
